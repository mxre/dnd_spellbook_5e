Spellbook Example
=================

This is a LaTeX package for a personalized D&D Spellbook

Spells are stored in the `spells` folder ordered by level (currently I only added spells I actually use)

`spellbook.tex` contains the list of known spells and `spells.sty` is the actual LaTeX package containing
the spell format.

This package is tested with LuaLaTeX and pdfLaTeX from TeX Live 2020.
