You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a
corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer
the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth
and can't be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the
target of this spell within the last 10 days. Until the
spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions.
The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the
languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or
repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer
a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes
you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's
soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the
corpse can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend
anything that has happened since it died, and can't
speculate about future events.
