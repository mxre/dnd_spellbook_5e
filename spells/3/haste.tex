\begin{spell}{Haste}{PHB}{\nth{3} level transmutation}
{
    \spTime{1 action}
    \spRange{30 feet}
    \spComponents{V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)}
    \spDuration{Concentration, up to 1 minute}
}
Choose a willing creature that you can see within range.
Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it
gains a +2~bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity
saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each
of its turns. That aclion can be used only to take the
Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide,
or Use an Object action.

When the spell ends, the target can't move or take
actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy
sweeps over it.
