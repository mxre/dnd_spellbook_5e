\begin{spell}{Counterspell}{PHB}{\nth{3} level abjuration}
{
    \spTime{1 reaction, which you take when you see
    a creature within 60~feet of you casting a spell}
    \spRange{60 feet}
    \spComponents{S}
    \spDuration{Instantaneous}
}
You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of
casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of \nth{3}
level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is
casting a spell of \nth{4} level or higher, make an ability
check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10~+
the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails
and has no effect.

\note{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of \nth{4} level or higher, the interrupted spell has
no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the
spell slot you used.
