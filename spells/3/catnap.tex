You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice
that you can see within range fall unconscious for the spell’s duration. The
spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to
shake or slap it awake. If a target remains unconscious for the full duration,
that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can’t be affected by this
spell again until it finishes a long rest.
\end{spell}
