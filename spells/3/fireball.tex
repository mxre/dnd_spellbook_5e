{
    \spTime{1 action}

A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a
point you choose within range and then blossoms with
a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature
in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must
make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6
fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable
objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

\note{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of \nth{4} level or higher, the damage increases by
1d6 for each slot level above \nth{3}.
