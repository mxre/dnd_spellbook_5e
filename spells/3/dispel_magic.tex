Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within
range. Any spell of \nth{3} level or lower on the target ends.
For each spell of \nth{4} level or higher on the target, make
an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The
DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check,
the spell ends.

\note{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of \nth{4} level or higher, you automatically end
the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's level is
equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.
