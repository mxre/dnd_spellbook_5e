You teleport yourself to an unoccupied space you can
see within range. Immediately after you disappear, a
blast of kinetic force hits each creature within
10~feet of the space you left must make a Constitution saving
throw, taking 3d6 thunder damage on a failed save,
or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can bring along objects as long as their weight
doesn't exceed what you can carry. You can also teleport
one willing creature of your size or smaller who is
carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature
must be within 5~feet of you when you cast this spell,
and there must be an unoccupied space within 5~feet of
your destination space for the creature to appear in; otherwise,
the creature is left behind.

\note{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of \nth{4} level or higher, the damage increases by
1d6 for each slot level above \nth{3}.
