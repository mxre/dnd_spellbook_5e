\begin{spell}{Necroblast}{Homebrew}{\nth{3} level evocation}
{
    \spTime{1 action}
    \spRange{150 feet}
    \spComponents{V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)}
    \spDuration{Instantaneous}
}
A blob of darkness from your pointing finger to a point you
choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into
an explosion of darkness and death. Each creature
in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must
make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d10
necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

Death spreads around corners. It rotts objects in the area that
aren’t being worn or carried.

\note{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of \nth{4}~level or higher, the damage increases by
1d10 for each slot level above \nth{3}.
