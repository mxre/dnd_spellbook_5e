The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life
force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee
spell attack against a creature within your reach. On
a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you
regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic
damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you can make the
attack again on each of your turns as an action.

\note{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of \nth{4} level or higher, the damage increases by
1d6 for each slot level above \nth{3}.
