An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a
point you choose within range. The wall appears in
any orientation you choose, as a horizontal ar vertical
barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating ar resting
on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical
dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10~feet, or you
can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-
10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with
another panel. In any form, the wall is Â¼~inch thick.
It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a
creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed
to one side of the wall (your choice which side).

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is
immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by \emph{dispel
magic}. A \emph{disintegrate} spell destroys the wall instantly,
however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane,
blocking ethereal travel through the wall.
