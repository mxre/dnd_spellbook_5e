This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you
touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken
key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the
break or tear is no larger than 1~foot in any dimension,
you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct,
but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.
