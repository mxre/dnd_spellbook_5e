You point at one creature you can see within range, and the
sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it for a
moment. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
take 1d8 necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of
its hit points, it instead takes 1d12 necrotic damage.

\note{At Higher Levels.} The spell's damage increases by one
die when you reach \nth{5}~level (2d8 or 2d12),
\nth{11}~level (3d8 or 3d12), and \nth{17}~level (4d8 or 4d12).
\end{spell}
