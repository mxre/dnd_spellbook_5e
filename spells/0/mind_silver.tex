You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into
the mind of one creature you can see within range.
The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving
throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and subtract 1d4
from the next saving throw it makes before the end
of your next turn.
This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you
reach certain levels: \nth{5} level (2d6), \nth{11} level (3d6),
and \nth{17} level (4d6).
