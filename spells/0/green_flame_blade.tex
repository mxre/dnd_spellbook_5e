You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make
a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of
you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal
effects, and you can cause green fire to leap from the target
to a different creature of your choice that you can see within
5~feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to
your spellcasting ability modifier.

\note{At Higher Levels.} At \nth{5}~level, the melee attack deals
an extra 1d8~fire damage to the target on a hit, and the fire
damage to the second creature increases to 1d8~+ your spellcasting
ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at \nth{11}~level
(2d8 and 2d8) and \nth{17}~level (3d8 and 3d8).
