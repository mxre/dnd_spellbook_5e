You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments
at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear
you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have
disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end
of its next turn.

\note{At Higher Levels.} The spell's damage increases by 1d4
when you reach \nth{5}~level (2d4), \nth{11}~level (3d4),
and \nth{17}~level (4d4).
\end{spell}
