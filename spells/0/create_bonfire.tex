You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within
range. Until the spell ends, the magic bonfire fills a
5-foot cube. Any creature in the bonfire's space when you
cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or
take 1d8 fire damage. A creature must also make the saving
throw when it moves into the bonfire's space for the first
time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The bonfire ignites flammable objects in its area that
aren't being worn or carried.

\note{At Higher Levels.} The spell's damage increases
by 1d8 when you reach certain levels: \nth{5} level (2d8),
\nth{11} level (3d8), and \nth{17} level (4d8).
