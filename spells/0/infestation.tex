}
You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to
appear momentarily on one creature you can see within
range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving
throw, or it takes 1d6 poison damage and moves 5~feet
in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at
least 5~feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1,~north; 2,~south;
3,~east; or 4,~west. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity
attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked,
the target doesn't move.

\note{At Higher Levels.} The spell's damage increases by
1d6 when you reach \nth{5} level (2d6), \nth{11} level (3d6),
and \nth{17} level (4d6).
