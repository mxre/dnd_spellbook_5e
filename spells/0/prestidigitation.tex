This spell is a minor magical trick that novice
spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the
following magical effects within range:

\begin{itemize}
\item You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory
    effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind,
    faint musi­cal notes, or an odd odor.
\item You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle,
    a torch, or a small campfire.
\item You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger
    than 1~cubic foot.
\item You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1~cubic foot of
    nonliv­ing material for 1 hour.
\item You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear
    on an object or a surface for 1~hour.
\item You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image
    that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of
    your next turn.
\end{itemize}

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to
three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time,
and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
