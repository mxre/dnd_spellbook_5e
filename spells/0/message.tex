You point your finger toward a creature within range and
whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears
the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can
hear. You can cast this spell through solid objects if you
are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the
barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common
metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the
spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and
can travel freely around corners or through openings.
