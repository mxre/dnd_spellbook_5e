{
    \spTime{1 action}
    \spRange{Self (5-foot radius)}
    \spComponents{S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)}
    \spDuration{Instantaneous}
}
You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and
make a melee attack with it against one creature within
5~feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon
attack's normal effects and then becomes sheathed in
booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the
target willingly moves 5~feet or more before then, the
target takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.

\note{At Higher Levels.} The spell's damage increases by
1d8 when you reach \nth{5} level (2d8), \nth{11} level (3d8),
and \nth{17} level (4d8).
\end{spell}
