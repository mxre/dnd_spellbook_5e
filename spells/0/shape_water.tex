}
You choose an area of water that you can see within range
and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in
one of the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow
of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction.
This movement doesn't have enough force to cause damage.
\item You cause the water to form into simple shapes and
animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.
\item You change the water's color or opacity. The water
must be changed in the same way throughout. This change
lasts for 1 hour.
\item You freeze the water, provided that there are no
creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.
\end{itemize}
If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more
than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time,
and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
