You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a
creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against
the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On
a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can't
regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until
then, the hand clings to the target. If you hit an undead
target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against
you until the end of your next turn.

\note{At Higher Levels.} The spell's damage increases by
1d8 when you reach \nth{5} level (2d8), \nth{11} level (3d8),
and \nth{17} level (4d8).
\end{spell}
