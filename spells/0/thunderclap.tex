You create a burst of thunderous sound, which can be heard
100~feet away. Each creature other than you within 5~feet
of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature takes 1d6 thunder damage.

\note{At Higher Levels.} The spell's damage increases by 1d6
when you reach \nth{5}~level (2d6), \nth{11}~level (3d6),
and \nth{17}~level (4d6).
