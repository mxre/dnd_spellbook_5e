Choose one object weighing 1~to 5~pounds within range
that isn't being worn or carried. The object flies in a
straight line up to 90~feet in a direction you choose
before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts
against a solid surface. If the object would strike a
creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, the object strikes the target and stops
moving. When the object strikes something, the object
and what it strikes each take 3d8 bludgeoning damage.

\note{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of \nth{2}~level or higher, the maximum weight of
objects that you can target with this spell increases by
5~pounds, and the damage increases by 1d8, for each slot
level above \nth{1}.
