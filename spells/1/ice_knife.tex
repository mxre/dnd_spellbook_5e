You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature
within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target.
On a hit, the target takes 1d10 piercing damage. Hit
or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each
creature within 5~feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity
saving throw or take 2d6 cold damage.

\note{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of \nth{2} level or higher, the cold damage increases
by 1d6 for each slot level above \nth{1}.
