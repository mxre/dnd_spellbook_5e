    \spTime{1 minute}

    \spComponents{S, M (25 feet of rope, which the spell consumes)}
    \spDuration{8 hours}
}
As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle
with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When
you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle
becomes a magic trap.

This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save
DC to be discerned.

The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large
creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the
spell's radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity
saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air,
leaving it hanging upside down 3~feet above the ground
or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the
spell ends.
