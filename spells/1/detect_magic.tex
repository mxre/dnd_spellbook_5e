For the duration, you sense the presence of magic
within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you
can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible
creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you
learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked
by 1~foot of stone, 1~inch of common metal, a thin sheet
of lead, or 3~feet of wood or dirt.
