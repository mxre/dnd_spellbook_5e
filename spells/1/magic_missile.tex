You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each
dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see
within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its
target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can
direct them to hit one creature or several.

\note{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of \nth{2} level or higher, the spell creates one
more dart for each slot level above \nth{1}
