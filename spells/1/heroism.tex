A willing creature you touch is imbued with bravery.
Until the spell ends, the creature is immune to being
frightened and gains temporary hit points equal to
your spellcasting ability modifier at the start of each
of its turns. When the spell ends, the target loses any
remaining temporary hit points from this spell.

\note{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of \nth{2} level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above \nth{1}.
