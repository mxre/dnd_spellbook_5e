A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward
a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of
lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged
spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target
takes 1d12 lightning damage, and on each of your turns
for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12
lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell
ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell
also ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or
if it has total cover from you.

\note{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of \nth{2} level ar higher, the initial damage
increases by 1d12 for each slot level above \nth{1}.
