}
A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each
creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10~feet
away from you. On a successful save, the creature
takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely
within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10~feet
away from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a
thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

\note{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of \nth{2} level or higher, the damage increases by
1d8 for each slot level above \nth{1}.
