The spell captures some of the incoming energy, lessening
its effect on you and storing it for your next melee
attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage
type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time
you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target
takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type, and
the spell ends.

\note{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of \nth{2} level or higher, the extra damage increases
by 1d6 for each slot level above \nth{1}.
