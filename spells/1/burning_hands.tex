}
As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers
spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your
outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone
must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6
fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects
in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

\note{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of \nth{2} level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d6 for each slot level above \nth{1}.
\end{spell}
