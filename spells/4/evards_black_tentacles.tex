    \spTime{1 action}

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on
ground that you can see within range. For the duration,
these tentacles turn the ground in the area into
difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first
time or a turn or starts its turn there, the creature
must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6
bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles
until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the
area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6
bludgeoning damage.

A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its
action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice)
against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
