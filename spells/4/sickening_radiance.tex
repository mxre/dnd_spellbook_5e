Dim, greenish light spreads within a 30-foot-radius sphere
centered on a point you choose within range. The light spreads
around corners, and it lasts until the spell ends.

When a creature moves into the spell's area for the first
time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must
succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 4d10 radiant
damage, and it suffers one level of exhaustion and emits a dim,
greenish light in a 5-foot radius. This light makes it impossible
for the creature to benefit from being invisible. The light and
any levels of exhaustion caused by this spell go away when the
spell ends.
