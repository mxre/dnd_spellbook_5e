Choose one creature you can see within range. Yellow
strips of magical energy loop around the creature. The
target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its
flying speed (if any) is reduced to 0 feet for the spell's
duration. An airborne creature affected by this spell safely
descends at 60 feet per round until it reaches the ground
or the spell ends.
