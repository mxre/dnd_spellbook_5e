A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell
ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is
invisible as long as it is on the target's person. The spell
ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

\note{At Higher Levels.} When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of \nth{3} level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above \nth{2}.
